# **CSE 15L Lab Report 1**

## Step 1 - Installing VS Code

- In order to complete the first lab, you will need to have VS Code installed, if it's not already installed on your device, go to this link: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Once on the page, download the version of VS Code for your respective OS. If you're not using Windows, click the arrow next to the "Download for Windows" button to reveal options for Linux and MacOS.

- At this point you have successfully completed the first step and are ready to move on.

## Step 2 - Installing Git and Remotely Connecting

- For this lab we will need to use a tool called git. If you are using Windows and have not installed this on your device already, go to this link: [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/)

- Once on the page, click the blue download button and run the file. Once it is installed, close and reopen VS Code to allow any changes to take effect.
