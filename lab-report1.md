# **CSE 15L Lab Report 1**

## Step 1 - Installing VS Code

- In order to complete the first lab, you will need to have VS Code installed, if it's not already installed on your device, go to this link: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Once on the page, download the version of VS Code for your respective OS. If you're not using Windows, click the arrow next to the "Download for Windows" button to reveal options for Linux and MacOS.

- Once you've downloaded that, run the file and open the program once it is finished installing. When it opens you should see something like this:

- At this point you have successfully completed the first step and are ready to move on.

## Step 2 - Obtaining your CSE 15L Account

- In order to get your CSE 15L account information, you will need to go to this link: [CSE15L](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

- If this is your first time logging in, under username you will put the same username you use for TritonLink and Canvas and for Student ID you will put your PID.

- Once you have logged in here, you will see your CSE 15L username under the "Additional Accounts" section. It will be the account name that begins with "cs15lsp23".

- Now that you have your username, you want to click on the password change tool above the "Additional Accounts" section to set a password for your CSE 15L account.

- Click the link as seen in the image above that takes you to the password change tool and then on the following screen select "Proceed to the Password Change Tool".

- Once you've reached the screen shown in the image below, you will want to enter your **CSE 15L Username**. After this, you will be taken to a screen where you can set the password for this account.

- We are now done with this step, but make sure to write down this username and password because it will be used later in the lab.

## Step 3 - Installing Git and Remotely Connecting

- For this lab we will need to use a tool called git. If you are using Windows and have not installed this on your device already, go to this link: [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/)

- Once on the page, click the blue download button and run the file. Once it is installed, close and reopen VS Code to allow any changes to take effect.

- Now that Git is installed, you want to go back to VS Code and click the "Terminal" button at the top and choose the "New Terminal" option.

- Once the terminal is open, you will want to click the arrow that's next to the plus sign near the top right of the terminal. In this menu, you want to select the "Git Bash" option.

- We will now begin the process of connecting to a remote server. First, in the terminal you want to write "ssh cs15lsp23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu" and hit enter. (**Rather than cs15lsp23xx you should write in your username that we found earlier**)

- After this you will be given a prompt in the terminal asking if you want to continue connecting since it is the first time you're connecting to this server. Type in "yes" then hit enter.
