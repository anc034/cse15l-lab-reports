# **CSE 15L Lab Report 5**

## **Debugging Scenario**

### **Step 1: Viewing the EdStem Post**

- For this lab report we will be running through a debugging scenario similar to those from [Lab 9](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week9/).

- To begin we need to look at the EdStem post made by the student who is having issues with their code in order to start figuring out what the possible issue is and how we can help.
